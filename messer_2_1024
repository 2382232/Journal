# Journal
10/24/16
Our goal today is to check on the parts to see if 
Mr. Davis has the frame/playfield/backboard, etc.
and to start working on the code in Arduino.
On Thursday and Friday I had login issues, so we
struggled to set up the Journal, but now it is finally done.

Our goal for today is to continue work on the Arduino circut,
but mainly to also (if we have the parts) work on the hardware
(playfield, mechanics, frame, etc.).
