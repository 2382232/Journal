Me and Jacosp have been working tirelessly on our code lately,
but have not fininished it yet; we will hopefully get it done
and over with very soon, but until then we will contininuer to
work on our code until it's fununctional. We have been making
progress, however. last Friday we were fininally able to get our
first light bulb lit. We will continue to work at this pace and keep
updating this journal so people can hear our story, and above all,
stay \e[31mRedDETERMINED\e[0m. This is Dave Messer, signing off.
